# Data Mining Project: Information Retrieval with Query Expansion and Evaluation

This project focuses on building a full-featured Information Retrieval (IR) system using the **Vaswani dataset**. It includes data collection, preprocessing, indexing, query processing, expansion using various embedding models, evaluation, and a simple web interface for user interaction.

---

##  Project Features

- Document and query handling using `ir_datasets`
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stop word removal, stemming)
- Inverted index construction
- Query preprocessing and TF-IDF based ranking
- Query expansion using:
  - GloVe word embeddings
  - ELMo contextual embeddings
  - BERT embeddings
- Retrieval performance evaluation (Precision, Recall, MAP)
- Flask-based web interface for searching documents

##  Methodology

### 1. Data Collection
- Downloaded the Vaswani dataset using `ir_datasets`.
- Extracted documents, queries, and Qrels.
- Stored data into `pandas` DataFrames for easier manipulation.

### 2. Preprocessing
- Performed standard preprocessing:
  - Lowercasing
  - Tokenization
  - Stop word removal
  - Stemming
  - Cleaning special characters and whitespace

### 3. Indexing
- Constructed an inverted index mapping each term to:
  - Document IDs it appears in
  - Term frequency per document

### 4.  Query Processing
- Preprocessed user queries in the same way as documents.
- Applied TF-IDF ranking to score documents for each query.

### 5.  Query Expansion
- Used **Relevance Feedback (RM3)** to improve query performance by analyzing top-ranked documents.
- Integrated **embedding models** for semantic similarity:
  - GloVe
  - ELMo
  - BERT
- Expanded the queries using semantically similar terms.

### 6. Evaluation
- Compared retrieved results with ground truth using Qrels.
- Calculated:
  - **Precision**
  - **Recall**
  - **Mean Average Precision (MAP)**

### 7. Web Interface
- Built with **Flask**.
